# cfftpack
C translation &amp; wrapper of Fortran FFTPACK library with a few extras.

Having wrapped components of FFTPACK several times, both personally and professionally
I finally decided to do a proper wrapper for the full thing, and open source it with a
permissive license, so I could use it for both personal and commercial projects. If other
people find it useful that is cool too.

This is alpha, pre release code. Not everything works properly yet.

Those with a quantitative finance background might find the test directory interesting. It contains
some work from as yet unpublished papers of mine.
