# cfftpack
C translation &amp; wrapper of Fortran FFTPACK library with a few extras.

Having wrapped components of fftpack several times, both personally and profressionally
I finally decided to do a propper wrapper for the full thing. And open source it with a
permissive licence so I could use it for both personal and professional projects. If other
people find it useful that is cool too.

This is alpha, pre release code. Not everything works properly yet.

Those with a quantitative finance background might find the test directory interesting. It contains
some work from as yet unpublished papers of mine.
